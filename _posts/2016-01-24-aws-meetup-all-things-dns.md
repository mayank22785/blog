Hello world!

We have always been strong supporters of building and growing user communities. We believe sharing knowledge is the best way to give back to the community.

AWS is certainly one of the most disruptive solutions of last decade. From the spark of an idea, to the first customer, to IPO and beyond, the worldâ€™s most progressive startups build and grow their businesses on Amazon Web Services.

[Jeevan][10] has been managing this Bangalore [AWS User Group][11] since a few years and now it has eventually become one of largest groups globally. Kudos!

This month's meet-up was all things DNS. [Hemant][8] and [Pradeep][9] were there with their crisp talk and goodies for around 100 AWS enthusiasts who turned on a Saturday. SATURDAY! This is a good sign that shows DevOps have been taken more seriously now. Hallelujah!
