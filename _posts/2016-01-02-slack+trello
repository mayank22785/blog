Communication is one of the most important aspects for any company.
Lack of communication creates a big problem for any company which is hard to solve.
We were facing a similar challenge sometime ago.As some of our company members,like me,
are working from remote locations,it becomes a challenge for us to communicate effectively.

Tools like Skype,email,dropbox etc. have been used for
quite sometime but it could not solve problems like this in a efficient manner.
In order to make things work a new medium of communication is required using which we 
solved our problem.

## What is Slack ?

Slack is a simple messaging service platform build for efficient team collabration and 
communication.Around the globe using Slack is quite easy and higly useful.

Slack has some great features that makes it easy and fun to communicate with.
From the starting of our usage with slack,we are very impressed with its perfomance,UI 
and capabilities.

The emojis are the best part about creating fun in the communication 
enviorment.Slack consists of a ton of different emojis to choose from.
Using these emojis you can easily express your reaction to others.

In the age of modern era,we need a bot to solve our problems like scheduling,reminders etc.
Slackbot is a automated robot that helped us in so many ways. We use Slackbot for 
scheduling,remainders,syncing etc.With the help of these features within Slack it has definitely 
made our work life much easier than ever before.

##  What is Trello ? 

Trello is a an awesome project management tool that makes collaboration easy.
Whether you're organizing work projects, family chores, travel plans, or just about anything else
trello is always a helpful tool for you.

Trello uses the concept of creating cards and adding your own lists.The list
consists of a variety of cards upon which you can update your everyday tasks.
The card can used to attach docs,images,due dates and remainders.
Using this method you can easily schedule you upcoming events,set remainders,
plans

In the case of our team's usage for trello,we have created several
different boards according to our channels on slack.Using this 
method we easily remain up to date with the work happening on the each channel.
