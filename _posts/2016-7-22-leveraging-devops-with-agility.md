##  The Problem

After implementing an awesome internal communication system for ourselves as I had discussed before in this [post][].We started analysing some common problems and a few drawbacks.Here are some of them:

* People neglect tasks
* Needs daily changes
* Gets messy with large number of people


So finally we decided to make it better. 

## What is Agility ?

[Agility][11] set of principles for software development in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing,cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change

##  Kanban

##  Scrum

The scrum methodology consists of 3 main parts product owner, scrum master, and
the development team. The development team consists of testers, designers, ops engineers and developers. 
Let's take a look at these different parts of scrum briefly and discover there roles

* Scrum Master

They coach the team, the product
owner, and the business on the scrum process and
look for ways to fine足tune their practice of it.Scrum masters are commonly mistaken for project
managers, when in fact, project managers don't
really have a place in the scrum methodology.Neither scrum masters
nor project managers nor product owners push
work to the team

* Scrum Team

most effective scrum
teams are tight足knit, co足located, and usually 5 to 7
members.Team members have differing skill sets,
and cross足train each other so no one person
becomes a bottleneck in the delivery of work.

* Product Owners

# Scrun vs Kanban

## Can it be made better ?

With some efforts we started transforming the way using which we can easily create and manage stuff.One of the most promising solutions to adapt was to combine the practices of Kanban and Scrum.But the unanswered question is that how to do it in the best possible manner ?

The best answer to this problem we found out was using Scrum over Kanban

We are having fun experimenting stuff,when are you planning to start exploring ? :)
