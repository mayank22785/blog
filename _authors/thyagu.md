Thyagu currently works as a `Principle Devops Engineer` @ Appcito, an Upstart and he is also a Good Student of Trending Technologies.

He is a Dedicated Devops Professional and a hands on person in Build, Deploy, Infrastructure Automation. He is responsible for Ecosystem Architectural Design, Implementation Strategy and Implementation of solutiona across Public Clouds such as AWS and Private Clouds such as OpenStack.

Thrown any situation, he would get the situation addressed, but more importantly, he would always prefer to jump in and get his hands dirty, learning every niche detail along the way. Anyone can use a Hammer (tool) but building the `hammer` (tool) to address the challenges is what Thyagu beleives in and concentrates on.

He likes to read and he just reads absolutely anything and everything that he can get his hands on.
